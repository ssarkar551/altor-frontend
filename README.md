# Next.js Dashboard with React-Chart-js and TailwindCSS

This repository contains a Next.js dashboard application designed to visualize data both in tables and graphical formats using React-Chart-js and style the UI with TailwindCSS. The dashboard showcases the integration of these technologies to create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing data visualization tool.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes React-Chart-js to create interactive charts and graphs for data representation.
- **Responsive Design**: Employs TailwindCSS for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Next.js Framework**: Leverages the powerful features of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
